## Mobile Banking Transaction Analytics

This Analytics was done for an organganization I worked with so the data would not be available.

### Aim of Analytics
The Aim of the analytics was to guage how customers interacted with the different features of the company's mobile banking app. This would help the organization:
- Identify products/services to suggest to customers based off their frequent transactions
- Identify customers with high churn probability
- Increase interaction from customers through tailored promotions/campaigns for customers
- Identify if a feature needs to be optimized or improved

The analytics involved tracking customer transactions using the different features of the mobile app and placing customers in a frequency bucket according 
to the frequency of their transactions.
Some of the skills used include: CTEs, Joins, Window functions, Group by etc.
